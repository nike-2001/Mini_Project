Project on Crop Yield Prediction using Flask and Machine Learning

## Abstract

Agriculture is the field which plays an important role in improving our countries economy. Agriculture is the one which gave birth to civilization. India is an agrarian country and its economy largely based upon crop productivity. Hence we can say that agriculture can be backbone of all business in our country. Selecting of every crop is very important in the agriculture planning. The selection of crops will depend upon the different parameters such as market price, production rate and the different government policies. Many changes are required in the agriculture field to improve changes in our Indian economy. We can improve agriculture by using machine learning techniques which are applied easily on farming sector. Along with all advances in the machines and technologies used in farming, useful and accurate information about different matters also plays a significant role in it. The concept of this paper is to implement the crop selection method so that this method helps in solving many agriculture and farmers problems. This improves our Indian economy by maximizing the yield rate of crop production.

## Proposed System

We have considered only the Naive Bayes method and K-Nearest Neighbour method. Using these two methods we can predict which crops to be selected for their land and season.this application we can do single testing by giving input as crop name, season selected and place selected. We can use any method among KNN or NB method. As soon you give the input you can select the method and mine the results. The results will tell you the yield rate of that crop.And we can do multiple testing by analyzing the datasets. In analyzing it allows you to select a whole file at once and get the accuracy.
